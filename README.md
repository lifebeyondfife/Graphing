Graphing

Draw beautiful bezier curve function graphs using wacky dynamically compiled code that *you* provide

Render a Bezier curve graph by describing a function and its first order derivative. The wacky part here is that you describe it by supplying C# code into a textbox that is dynamically compiled and used internally as a lambda function.
